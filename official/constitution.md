13. _Natural Disaster_ - Everybody loses 5 points. 
14. Optional: Gain 4 points. If you do, each other player may choose to gain 2 points.
15. _Mirror Mirror_ - Any points gained or lost by all players on this turn are doubled. 
16. Nobody can earn any points on this turn, for any reason. This supersedes all rules governing the earning of points. Otherwise, the turn proceeds as usual. 
17. Optional: Lose 10 points. If you do, gain 1 Prestige. Only possible if you have at least 10 points.
18. Optional: Lose 1 Prestige. If you do, take a bonus turn immediately after this one ends, but do not draw an Event Card on that turn. After that turn, the game continues with the regular turn order. Only possible if you have at least 1 Prestige.
19. All other players may each optionally gain 1 point. For every player who chooses to do so, you also gain 1 point. Players must make their decision publicly within 8 hours of this card being drawn, or they default to not taking the point. These 8 hours do not pause the game, all other timing proceeds as usual. 
20. _Hurry up!_ ‚Äì¬†If this card was drawn during the Pre-Proposal Phase of your turn, you have 1 hour from when it was drawn to submit a Rule Proposal for voting on this turn. If you do not do so, your turn ends at that time. This supersedes any other rules that prescribe the timing of events on a turn, or the parts of a turn that must occur. 
21. Immediately gain Points equal to your Prestige (rounded down), up to a maximum of 6. This overrides any restriction on your ability to gain points. 
22. Immediately gain Points equal to the base 2 logarithm of your Infamy (rounded down), up to a maximum of 6. This overrides any restriction on your ability to gain points. 
23. Immediately gain Points equal to your Win Count, up to a maximum of 6. 
24. Immediately gain Points equal to the difference between your own Win Count and the highest Win Count of any player. 
25. If you are in the Hoi Polloi, all members of the Hoi Polloi immediately gain 2 Points. If you are on the Council, all members of the Council immediately gain 3 Points. 
26. If you are in the Hoi Polloi, all members of the Council must vote publicly during the Voting Phase of the current turn. If you are on the Council, all members of the Hoi Polloi must vote publicly during the Voting Phase of the current turn. This overrides any other rules specifying vote secrecy. 
27. Take note of your current Score, and then set your Score to 0. In your next Consequences phase as the active player, set your Score back to its original value, regardless of what happened in the interim. You then cannot gain any further points on that turn. This overrides any other rule governing the gaining of points.
28. On your next die roll, you may reroll one die. 
29. On your next die roll, you may modify the value of any one die by up to 2 in either direction, as long as the new result makes sense for gameplay (_i.e._, you could gain 2 extra points ‚Äì¬†but you couldn‚Äôt draw a card from outside of the boundary of the card deck size). Using the /card command counts as a die roll and you can modify the resulting card number with this ability.
30. If any other player gives you points on this turn, gain an equal number of free points (up to a maximum of 6 free points for your entire turn). The free points are not taken from the other player, they just appear out of nowhere. 
31. In the Consequences phase of this turn, gain 1 free extra point for each different player who has given you at least 1 Point during this turn. The extra points are not taken from other players, they just appear out of nowhere.
32. _Beware the Ides of June_ -- You MUST remember that time when Julian and Chris broke the game on 23 June 2019.  You MAY discuss it in three or more sentences in chat.  Should you choose to do so, gain one point.
33. _Moi?  Oh, Do Go On..._ -- You are a Person‚Ä¶ of Interest (POI).  
34. _And Where Were You on the Night of the 23rd?..._ -- You are a Person‚Ä¶ of Interest (POI).  
35. _I Ain‚Äôt Got Nut‚Äôin Ta Say Ta No CAHP..._ -- You are a Person‚Ä¶ of Interest (POI).  
36. _Sure, I Knew the Guy..._ -- You are a Person‚Ä¶ of Interest (POI).
37. _And I‚Äôd Do It Again Too_ -- You have been convicted of MURDER.  Choose One:  gain INFAMY (or) lose half your PRESTIGE, rounding up (or) lose half your POINTS, rounding up.
38. _Happy Birthday, Mr. President - _you are elected President of the Nom-ited States.  If you are a member of the Hoi Polloi, you replace the Council member with the lowest prestige and they become a member of the Hoi Polloi.  Council status is recalculated each time prestige is modified.
39. _The Grassy Knoll - _ you have been convicted of MURDER.  However, all effects which would modify your prestige, infamy, or score from drawing this event card are prevented.
40. _What, Too Soon? - _you may discard all of the event cards that were drawn this turn (including this one) and draw an equal number of event cards. 

Notes: 

* Cards #1-20 have ordinal number 340.
* Cards #21-31 have ordinal number 380.
* Cards #32-37 have ordinal number 383.

## RULES[^4]


### Basic Rules


#### 345

The players in this game of Nomic, listed in turn-order are:


    1. Brian Keith


    2. Dave Mankoff


    3. Kevin Safford


    4. Julian Eskin


    5. Chris Bett

Players shall alternate in turn-order, taking one whole turn apiece. 


#### 101

All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect whenever a game begins. The Initial Set consists of rules 101-116 (immutable) and 201-203 (mutable).


#### 116

Whatever is not explicitly prohibited or regulated by a rule is permitted and unregulated, with the sole exception of changing the rules, which is permitted only when a rule or set of rules explicitly or implicitly permits it.


#### 113

A player always has the option to forfeit the game rather than continue to play or incur a game penalty. No penalty worse than losing, in the judgement of the player to incur it, may be imposed. 


#### 410

A rule change is any of the following:



1. the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a mutable rule or a super-mutable rule
2. the transmutation of an immutable rule into a mutable rule, a mutable rule into a super-mutable rule, or vice versa


#### 397

‚ÄúREPLACING‚Äù a rule is the combined action of repealing it and then enacting a new rule.  


#### 205

An adopted rule change takes full effect at the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it.


#### 370

Any property of a player that changes does so at the time a rule dictates the change takes place. Updating records of that change must occur before the next turn begins but updating the records is merely a convenience for all players and does not dictate when the change actually took place.


### Turn Structure


#### 337

This supersedes Rule 315.

A player may voluntarily skip their entire turn, by explicitly stating this in email or Slack. A turn can be skipped any time before that turn‚Äôs Voting Phase has begun.

If any negative effects ought to have affected a player during their turn, those effects are still applied, even if their turn is skipped. 


#### 398

One player's turn consists of four parts, in this order:



1. ‚ÄúPre-Proposal Phase,‚Äù involving any time that transpires before a proposal is put forward.
2. ‚ÄúVoting Phase,‚Äù involving proposing one ‚ÄúRule Change‚Äù and having it voted on.
3. ‚ÄúScore Phase,‚Äù in which the current player throws or simulates throwing a number of dice once and adds the result to their score. The number and type of dice are defined by the STRENGTH TABLE based on that turn‚Äôs proposal. When throwing multiple dice, the result is either the highest or the lowest single value from one die, as defined by the STRENGTH TABLE. 
4. ‚ÄúConsequence Phase,‚Äù involving all actions not covered in the Pre-Proposal Phase, Voting Phase, or Score Phase that should be concluded before the next player's turn can begin. This includes but is not limited to awarding points to non-current players and updating the constitution to include passed proposals.


#### 316

A player has at most 72 hours to complete the phases prior to the Consequence Phase of their turn, herein referred to as the ‚ÄúTurn Window,‚Äù unless an Extension is granted.


#### 317

Players may request an ‚ÄúExtension‚Äù of their Turn Window at any time in the first 24 hours of their turn and before they submit their proposal, but not after either of those conditions have passed. They may also request an Extension to their turn before their turn begins. The duration of the Extension must be stated at the time when it is requested. An Extension is granted if at least 50% of the other players agree. An Extension has 24 hours to be agreed upon. Any abstentions will be treated as votes in favor of the Extension. At any time during an Extension, the player may request a further Extension, and it may be granted by the same mechanism.

An Extension is not considered a rule change or proposal, as defined in the constitution. Any rules regarding unanimity, voting, scoring, or other such subjects regarding rule changes do not apply to Extensions.


#### 344

As the first action of their turn, at the beginning of Pre-Proposal phase, the current player may optionally draw 1 Event Card. 


#### 405

During the Consequence Phase, all players take actions required of them, as appropriate. If the order of actions taken during this phase matters, then they will be taken in turn order, starting with the Current Player, unless a different order is specified by the rules invoking those particular actions. 

The Consequence Phase ends 12 hours after it began, or as soon as all required actions have been taken. If not all required actions have been taken, the Consequence Phase (and thereby the current turn) will be nevertheless be considered finished and players forfeit the untaken actions. If players failed to complete any actions that might be considered a detriment to them, a judgment can be invoked and those actions can be taken for them by another player such that the detriment cannot be avoided.

The next player's turn begins at 10 a.m. Eastern following the completion of the current player's Consequence Phase. They then become the current player.[^5]


#### 325

Before the end of the Consequences phase, each player updates the public accounting of their own Score, Prestige and Infamy, to reflect any changes that occurred during that turn. They may ask another player to do it for them. If they fail to do either, a Judgment may be invoked in order to achieve the changes necessary.


#### 418 (SM)

_The state of the Nom-ion is STRONG._

On each turn, if one or more players have increased their win count, then the normal turn order is interrupted.  Conclude the current player‚Äôs turn as normal.  Then, delay the start of the next player‚Äôs turn to deliver a STATE OF THE UNION address.  This address lasts until all players say they are ready for the next turn to begin, or at most 18 hours, but it does not follow the normal structure.  The state of the union occurs as follows.



1. The end of the previous player‚Äôs turn is observed, followed by a moment of silence.
2. Starting at 9:00am on the following day, any player may post multiple GIF‚Äôs and (or) still images of parades in the GENERAL and PROPOSAL DISCUSSION chat channels.
3. At 7:00pm that evening, each player whose win count was increased is strongly encouraged to thank all of the little people who made this possible.
4. Following that address, the Council member with the highest prestige should address the group as to the state of infamy and prestige since the last win count.  If this player is also the MIPWEL, then they are STRONGLY encouraged to impersonate Richard Nixon while doing so.
5. Following this, the Council member with the highest points should address the group as to the state of points since the last win count.
6. Once these speeches are concluded, all winners and Council members should remain available for discussion, in order to answer questions, comments, and concerns raised by the press and by the common citizens (as represented by the Hoi Polloi and only the Hoi Polloi).
7. For the remainder of the turn, all players are encouraged to discuss past or future proposals, events of intrigue which have transpired, alliances (both secret and overt), or ‚Äúthe good old days.‚Äù  Alternatively, any player may choose to take HOLIDAY until the next player‚Äôs turn begins.  Being on HOLIDAY has no in-game effect. 


### Voting


#### 104

All rule changes proposed in the proper way shall be voted on. They will be adopted if and only if they receive the required number of votes.


#### 105

Every player is an eligible voter. Every eligible voter must participate in every vote on rule changes.


#### 207

Each player has exactly one vote.


#### 412

Any proposed rule change must be written down before it is voted on. If adopted, it must guide play in the form in which it was voted on.  However, this form is subject to the rules regarding super-mutability until the start of the next voting phase (i.e. next turn).  By <span style="text-decoration:underline;">unanimous agreement</span>, any final proposal may be amended before the next new rule is proposed.


#### 107

No rule change may take effect earlier than the moment of the completion of the vote that adopted it, even if its wording explicitly states otherwise. No rule change may have retroactive application.[^6]


#### 111

If a rule change as proposed is unclear, ambiguous, paradoxical, or clearly destructive of play, or if it arguable consists of two or more rule changes compounded, or is an amendment that makes no difference, or if it is otherwise of questionable value, then the other players may suggest amendments or argue against the proposal before the vote. A reasonable amount of time must be allowed for this debate. The proponent decides on the final form in which the proposal is to be voted on and decides the time to end debate and vote. The only cure for a bad proposal is prevention: a negative vote.


#### 304

If a proposed amendment names specific players, or targets specific players by any other mechanism, it must pass unanimously. 


#### 318

The Voting Phase <span style="text-decoration:underline;">begins</span> when the current player posts a rule proposal (by email or Slack), with a statement indicating that this is their final proposal.

The Voting Phase <span style="text-decoration:underline;">ends</span> as soon as any <span style="text-decoration:underline;">one</span> of the following has occurred: 



1. All eligible voters have cast votes.
2. The time is 12:00PM (noon), 2 calendar days after the Voting Phase began.
3. The current Turn Window ends.

Any votes submitted after the Voting Phase has ended will not be counted.

If the Voting Phase of a turn ends for either of the first two reasons above, it is ‚ÄúComplete,‚Äù because all eligible voters either voted or had ample chance to do so.

If the Voting Phase of a turn ends because the Turn Window ended, then it is ‚ÄúIncomplete,‚Äù because eligible voters were not afforded sufficient time to vote.

For the Voting Phase to Complete properly, it should start it with appropriate time to spare in the Turn Window. If insufficient time is allotted, it falls upon the current player to negotiate for others to vote early. Other players are not required to oblige.


#### 319

During a Voting Phase, eligible voters can explicitly submit any of the following votes, but no others:



*   Yes (or equivalents such as Yea/Aye/‚ÄúI agree‚Äù/‚ÄúI am in favor‚Äù)
*   No (or equivalents such as Nay/Disagree/‚ÄúI am not in favor‚Äù/‚ÄúFuck off with this crap‚Äù)
*   Abstain (or equivalents such as ‚ÄúPresent‚Äù)


#### 320

At the end of a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Complete</span> Voting Phase, any eligible voters who did not cast a vote are considered to have voted ‚ÄúAbstain‚Äù automatically. 


#### 321

At the end of an <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Incomplete</span> Voting Phase, any eligible voters who did not cast a vote are considered to have voted ‚ÄúNo‚Äù automatically. 


#### 322

Eligible voters who did not manually cast a vote in a Voting Phase, but who are considered to have voted automatically (by Rules 320 or 321), cannot gain Points or Prestige as a consequence of their vote. Such players may still have other actions applied to them during that turn. 


#### 326

A rule change is adopted if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. 

In this constitution, we define ‚Äúunanimous‚Äù as an absence of explicit objections ("No" votes). In other words, Abstentions do not cause a proposal to fail. The only exception is that if _every_ player abstains, the proposal does not pass. 


#### 386

Proposals only require at least a two thirds majority to pass.  The required majority is determined based on the final number and power of yea and nay votes. It is not determined based on the total number of players or by any abstentions (regardless of their power).


#### 306

Multiple numbered proposals may be submitted simultaneously for one player's turn. They must all pass, or else they all fail.

The proposals must all be voted on simultaneously in one poll using the highest bar required by the submitted proposals. If the proposals require incompatible voting mechanisms or standards, they can not be submitted together.

For any scoring purposes during the turn, they shall be treated as one single proposal. After the turn concludes, they shall be recognized as wholly independent amendments to the constitution. If this would result in a rule violation, they may not be submitted together.


#### 355

STRENGTH is a value from 0 to 10, which is assigned to each turn based on various aspects of the current player‚Äôs proposal.  STRENGTH is used to determine how many points are scored.  A turn always has the highest permissible STRENGTH, which is selected based on not exceeding the criteria below.  It is not required to include titles and footnotes in your word count, nor is it required to count rules which are referenced but not amended or superseded. (Note: The Strength Table was moved toward the top of the Constitution.)

The max words per category is increased when a proposal contains more than one rule.  For each rule beyond the first, add +15 to the max word count.[^7] The values in parentheses above represent the absolute max for that category (+15 times one less than the corresponding ‚Äúmax no. rules‚Äù).


#### 367

_Let us make amends_

In determining the appropriate score using the strength table:



*   A rule which is repealed or wholly superseded, or one from which words are deleted or replaced but not added, counts as minus one rule.
*   A word which is deleted from an existing rule counts as minus one word.
*   A proposal may include text regarding the removal of words or rules. It is not necessary to add the word count or rule count from that text.

Append and replace the strength table as follows: (Note: The Strength Table was moved toward the top of the Constitution.)


#### 428

One Time Effect:  The Congressional Record is created, and maintained separately from the Constitution and all other records.  This record follows the same rules for structure and formatting as the Nomic Constitution.  At the end of each turn, it may be edited as appropriate by a player whose proposal fails to pass.

If a proposal is not adopted, then it may be appended to the Congressional Record at the discretion of the active player.  When added, the proposal shall receive:



1. The current date.
2. The name of the author.
3. The results of the vote (e.g. number of yea, nay, and abstention votes).
4. A value of one SUPPORT associated with the author.

On subsequent turns, a proposal from the record may be used by the active player in place of their own.  If so, it appears for voting in exactly the same form.  However, it becomes super-mutable during the pre-proposal phase (before any votes are received).  It follows the normal rules for super-mutability of proposals after that.

A proposal which is resubmitted counts as having one additional yea vote per support!  Treat these yea votes in the same way as votes which are submitted during the normal voting process.  If the proposal is accepted, and if the author is not currently the active player, then the author receives ten points.


#### 429

The SUPPORT of past proposals may be increased in two ways.  This occurs after resolving the effects of any event cards you may have drawn.



1. If you are on the Council, you may CHASTISE THE SENATE instead of making a proposal.  You gain INFAMY.
2. If you are on the Hoi Polloi, you may RIOT IN THE STREETS instead of making a proposal.  This has no effect unless all members of the Hoi Polloi agree to do so.  Each member of the council loses d6 points and then gains one prestige.

Should either action be taken, open the Congressional Record and increase the SUPPORT of one proposal.  Associate that support with your name.  In the case of a riot, use only the active player‚Äôs name, and not the names of any other member of the Hoi Polloi.  Then, proceed to the consequence phase of your turn, skipping your proposal and your vote.

A proposal may have a maximum of one support associated with each player.  It may have a maximum combined value of two support.


### Scoring (points, prestige, infamy‚Ä¶)


#### 206

When a proposed rule change is defeated, the player who proposed it loses 10 points.


#### 327

If and when rule changes can be adopted without unanimity, the players who voted ‚ÄúNo‚Äù on winning proposals shall receive 10 points apiece. 


#### 323

After the Voting Phase of a player‚Äôs turn, any remaining time in the Turn Window will be allotted to the Score Phase. If no time remains, the Turn Window expires, or the current player fails to complete the actions of the Score Phase, the Score Phase does not occur.


#### 301

Each player has a property ascribed to them called "SCORE". A player's score is the sum total of the "POINTS" they currently control. The terms "SCORE" and "POINTS" show up in the original set 1 and 8 times, respectively, and this amendment does not override any property explicitly ascribed to these terms by the original set. "POINTS" are considered an element whose domain is unity. "Score" is considered a parameter whose domain are the natural numbers. When a player gains 1 or more "POINTS" they add each of these elements to their "SCORE" in succession. When a player loses 1 or more "POINTS", they remove these elements from their "SCORE" in succession. Anytime a rule would change a player's "SCORE" to a value outside of its domain (the natural numbers), that player's "SCORE" instead becomes 0. 


#### 307

If at any time the active player has no Prestige and that player has never done so, that player gains 1 Prestige.


#### 308

If at any time the active player has no Infamy and that player has never done so, that player gains 1 Infamy.


#### 309

If at any time a player's Prestige would fall below zero, that player's Prestige is instead set to zero. If at any time a player's Infamy would fall below zero, that player's Infamy is instead set to zero.


#### 409

If a player has zero Prestige, they may not gain points except by skipping a turn to gain 1 single solitary point.[^8]


#### 346

_A day which will live. Full stop._

When the infamy of a player increases by any amount, it instead increases by an amount equal to twice that of the "Most Infamous Person Who Ever Lived" (MIPWEL).  The MIPWEL is the player or person with the highest current infamy, as defined by the infamous INFAMOUS LIST which shall be appended to this constitution.

One-Time Event (occurs on Halloween, but not again):

Add the person "Oogie Boogie" to the INFAMOUS LIST and set his infamy to the average (mean) of all known infamies.

One-Time Event (occurs on Christmas Eve, but not again): 

Oogie Boogie gains infamy and, if possible, Santa Claus is removed from play. 


#### 358

_I didn't think he was capable of such evil_

The player(s) with the least infamy is/are given the title LIPWEL (Least Infamous Player(s) Who Ever Lived). Note that the title LIPWEL does not prevent any player from being Famous. An active player who is a LIPWEL can Dupe all other players. When a player is Duped, they lose 10% of their points rounded down and the LIPWEL gains those lost points. If a LIPWEL does this, then they gain 1 Infamy. They then again gain 1 Infamy.


#### 359

_Blending in with the crowd_

You may skip your turn to reduce your infamy by 50%.


#### 361

A Player may give all or a portion of their Score to another willing Player. Giving in this way must be publicly announced.


#### 381

At any time, once per Ascension, every player may gain Points equal to their Win Count. 

‚ÄúOnce per Ascension‚Äù means that every player can use the ability once, but then not again until somebody has ascended. They do not have to ascend themselves for the ability to reset. If somebody did not gain points this way during one Ascension, then they still can only do it once during the next Ascension (you can‚Äôt save up the ability).


#### 385



1. A player who is the only player to vote nay loses one prestige, if the proposal fails.  
2. A player who is the only player to vote yea gains infamy.  
3. A player who is the only player to abstain from a vote loses points equal to the number of players; then each other player gains one point.  This effect may only occur if that player could have influenced the result of the proposal by casting a vote.  The potential to influence a proposal should consider that player‚Äôs ability to gain POWER by any means.


#### 392

At any time, once per turn, the active player may EITHER set their score to zero to gain 1 Prestige OR they may reduce their score by 20 to gain 1 Prestige. They must publicly state that they are doing so.  This effect may not occur if the active player has lost points this turn (e.g. by gifting or by drawing a card) and this effect may not occur if the active player is the MIPWEL or has gained INFAMY this turn.


#### 399

_Popular Support_

When the proposal of a Council member passes unanimously, each member of the Hoi Polloi who cast a ‚Äúyea‚Äù vote receives 3pts.


#### 400

_Rags to Riches_

If a member of the Hoi Polloi ever becomes the player with the highest score (Player A), then immediately determine which member of the Hoi Polloi has the highest prestige (Player B).  Player A gains prestige until they have exactly one more prestige than Player B.  If this would cause any players to join or leave the Council, then they do so at the end of the current turn.  

‚ÄúRags to Riches‚Äù occurs once per win.  It will not occur again until a win count (belonging to any player) has increased.

One-Time Effect:  Horatio Alger is added to the INFAMOUS LIST with zero infamy.  If Horatio Alger is ever MURDERED then the hopes and dreams of the American working class die with him.


#### 407

Players may trade 1 prestige to gain points, at most twice per turn. The number gained is 10 points, minus 10% (rounded down) of the player's score. 


#### 415

Any effect that considers the amount of infamy any player has will only consider infamy belonging to actual players of the game and not any non-player characters (NPC's) such as historical or made up figures that are not actively playing the game, even if the rule in question mentions any NPC's.


### Win Conditions


#### 423

The following are win conditions for players. There can also be other win conditions.

1. They have a score higher than (100 + their infamy score + 2 ^ their Win Count).

2. BRIAN'S LAUNCH PROTOCOL is activated while they are the MIPWEL.

3. _Barren Glory: _They have 0 points, 0 prestige, and 0 infamy at the start of their turn.

If a rule refers to a LAUNCH PROTOCOL, then that _alone_ shall not constitute a mention of a specific player‚Äôs name. In other words, amending such a rule is subject to normal voting rules. 


#### 365

_Plugging the hole_

If the MIPWEL submits a proposal, and it fails TRUE UNANIMOUSLY (every player votes "Nay") in a Complete voting phase, BRIAN'S LAUNCH PROTOCOL is activated at the moment when the voting phase ends. 


#### 422

When a player meets a WIN CONDITION, they WIN. If a win condition mentions "the first player‚Äù to achieve something, then that player WINS only once, at that time, even though they will continue always having been the first. If any rule labels a player as ‚Äúthe WINNER,‚Äù that player WINS _once_ at that time, but is not considered ‚Äúthe winner‚Äù in perpetuity. Rule 213 is an exception, where ‚Äúthe winner‚Äù may have another meaning. 

When a player WINS, the following happens in this order: 



1. They ASCEND: 
    *   They gain 1 Prestige. 
    *   Their Score is reset to 0. 
    *   They gain 1 Win Count. 
2. Other actions are performed, if prescribed by rules.
3. If the winning player is the active player, their turn ends immediately. 
4. The game continues. 


### Player Roles


#### 350

At any moment that a player is one of the top two players ordered first by highest Prestige, then by least Infamy, then by most points, then by most recent accepted proposal, that player is on The Council.


#### 351

Any player not on the The Council is a member of the Hoi Polloi.


#### 352

Once per proposal, if the active player is on The Council, they may reduce their Prestige by 1 to alter exactly one vote of exactly one member of the Hoi Polloi. This happens after votes are tallied and made public, but before determining if the proposal is accepted. The voting for a proposal or rule that would target a specific player can not have votes altered by this rule.


#### 353

Members of the Hoi Polloi must draw one event card at the start of their turn.


#### 360

_Resistance Fighter_

If you are the active player, and a member of the Hoi Polloi, you may gain 1 infamy to reduce the points of any player on the Council by 1d6. This ability can only be activated once per turn.


#### 384

A Person of Interest (POI) gains INFAMY if they leave the U.S. state or other Country where they were located at the time they became a POI.  When any player is convicted of MURDER, all POIs (except the convicted player) immediately gain 1 PRESTIGE. Any time a POI gains PRESTIGE they immediately lose the title of POI. 

If at any time a player suggests that they are going to murder another person, even in jest, then that player becomes a Person of Interest.

JACK THE RIPPER (who appears on the INFAMOUS LIST) is always considered to be a Person of Interest and he may never gain PRESTIGE. 


#### 406

_Guillotine_

If a proposal was made by a Council member, the Hoi Polloi may collectively spend a total of 2 prestige to block its approval, regardless of the vote outcome. This can happen before or after votes are tallied and made public, but must happen before determining if the proposal is accepted. If this happens before all eligible voters have voted, the voting phase ends immediately, but is considered incomplete (this overrides rule 318). 


#### 408

_Role Model_

Players can have specific ROLES. Roles can define in-turn, or out-of-turn, effects and abilities. This rule only takes effect after at least 6 roles have been defined. 

To start their turn (but after playing events, if necessary), the current player must select an available role. They retain that role until they select a new role on their following turn, unless they lose the role due to some other effect. Roles currently held by any player are unavailable, including the old role still held by the active player before they select a new one. If no role is available, the current player nevertheless loses their old role, and must proceed without a new role. 

During each Consequences phase, add 1 point of VALUE to each available role, except the role that was made available by the current player on this turn. A table of roles is maintained to track values and availability. When a role is selected, the player selecting it immediately adds its value to their score, and resets the rule value to 0.

One-Time Effect (**after 6 roles exist**): Add this Event Card:

41. This turn, you may select *any* role, even unavailable ones. If you take another player's role, pay them points equal to your Win Count, or as many points as you have, if not enough. That player will then have no role until they select a new one on their turn. 


#### 416

Add the following Role to the game:

The Pope - When the Pope role is chosen, everyone's infamy is reduced by the infamy score of the LIPWEL. The Pope cannot take any action that would cause him to gain infamy. When the current Pope chooses a new role, he gives any player 1 infamy.


### Event Cards


#### 379

Event Cards are drawn using the /card command on Slack. If that command is not functioning or  is not up-to-date with the Card Deck, then cards may be drawn using /roll with appropriately sized virtual dice.

Event Cards cannot be saved for future use. If non-optional, their effects apply immediately when played. If optional, their effects either apply immediately when played, or their effects are forfeited. 

There is no ‚Äúdiscard pile.‚Äù After an Event Card has been¬†drawn, it goes ‚Äúback in the deck‚Äù and it can come up again when the next Event Card is drawn. When drawing multiple cards at the same time, it is possible to draw the same card twice. 

This supersedes Rules 344 and 353, specifically by redefining the number of cards to be drawn and played when following those rules. Otherwise, those rules remain in effect as written. 

When playing Event Cards, players draw and play cards the following numbers of cards, according to their position in the Win Count ranking:



*   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Leader</span>: Any player with the highest Win Count draws 1 card and plays it. Multiple players can tie for the highest Win count.
*   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Follower</span>: Any player with fewer Wins than the Leader publicly draws 2 cards and chooses 1 of them to play, except:
*   <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Loser</span>: Any player in last place by Win Count publicly draws 3 cards and chooses 2 of them to play, in either order. 

If there are only two ranks shared among all players, then there is no Loser. In that case, every player is either a Leader or Follower. If all players are tied for the same Win Count, then every player is a Leader. 

Drawing and then playing cards is a single uninterruptible action. Thus, players cannot take any other game actions in between drawing cards and playing them. This overrides any rule that states that something may happen ‚Äúat any time‚Äù. 

If playing multiple cards, the entirety of the first card‚Äôs effects must be completed before moving on to the next card. 


#### 343

If a conflict needs to be resolved between an Event Card and other rules, Event Cards are considered to have the same ordinal number as the rule that created them, unless otherwise stated.


### Organization and Style of the Constitution


#### 374

Rules do not need to appear in ordinal order in the Constitution. This does not change the manner in which they are numbered.


#### 375

The order of Rules, Tables,  , Errata, etc. in the Constitution may be changed by a simple majority vote. Headings and other organizational structure may also be added or removed in this manner. Rules may not be split, edited, reworded, or otherwise changed via this mechanism.

Such changes must not affect Rule interpretation when implemented. Such changes must not cause other Rules to become invalid when implemented.

Such changes may occur outside of normal turn order. Such changes are not considered as Proposals and do not in any way affect the Current Player‚Äôs turn. Such changes must be proposed independently of the Current Player‚Äôs proposals. Such changes must be made during a Consequence Phase in order to help ensure this.

**426**

Text effects including color, boldness, strikethrough etc. have no meaning when interpreting rules. Rules may be given titles by their authors. Any player may add footnotes. Rule titles and footnotes carry no meaning when interpreting rules. 


### Conflict Resolution


#### 108

Each proposed rule change shall be given a rank-order number (ordinal number) for reference. The numbers shall begin with 301, and each rule change proposed in the proper way shall receive the next successive integer, whether or not the proposal is adopted.

If a rule is repealed and then re-enacted, it receives the ordinal number of the proposal to re-enact it. If a rule is amended or transmuted, it receives the ordinal number of the proposal to amend or transmute it. If an amendment is amended or repealed, the entire rule of which it is a part receives the ordinal number of the proposal to amend or repeal the amendment.


#### 211

If two or more mutable rules conflict with one another, or if two or more immutable rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

If at least one of the rules in conflict explicitly says of itself that it defers to another rule (or type or rule) or takes precedence over another rule (or type of rule), then such provisions shall supersede the numerical method for determining precedence.

If two or more rules claim to take precedence over one another or to defer to one another, then the numerical method must again govern.


#### 334

When a new rule amends, replaces, or repeals an existing rule, or part of an existing rule, the new rule must explicitly state this about itself, or the existing rule will still be in effect. [^9] 


#### 368

If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule, then a random player is chosen to be the judge to decide the question. Disagreement, for the purposes of this rule, may be created by the insistence of any player. Such a process is called invoking judgement.

The Judge's judgement may be overruled only by a unanimous vote of the other players. If a Judge's judgement is overruled, the player preceding the Judge in the playing order becomes the new Judge for the question.

Unless a Judge is overruled, one Judge settles all questions arising from the game until the disagreement has been resolved, including questions as to his or her own legitimacy and jurisdiction as Judge.

New Judges are not bound by the decisions of old Judges. All decisions by Judges shall be in accordance with all the rules then in effect; but when the rules are silent, inconsistent, or unclear on the point at issue, then the Judge's only guides shall be common morality, common logic, and the spirit of the game.


#### 311

If the conclusion of judgement includes a ruling that a player willfully and knowingly violated a rule, that player loses one Prestige.


### Other Rules


#### 314

Whenever times of day are given in this Constitution, they are given in the [Eastern time zone.](https://time.is/ET) This means EST, or EDT during daylight savings time. 

**424**

The following are One-Time Effects:



*   Non-recurring gain or loss of Points, Prestige, Infamy, Win Count or similar quantities
*   Addition or removal of players from the game
*   Repealing of rules

Rules may describe other One-Time Effects.

If a rule has any One-Time Effects, and that rule is repealed/replaced/amended after the effect has already been implemented, then the effect is not reversed. 

Proposed rules that consist _entirely_ of One-Time Effects may be tagged by their author with the [INSTANT] tag. After an [INSTANT] rule is approved, and after the effects have been executed, the [INSTANT] rule is then immediately and automatically repealed because it could have no further function. The word count and rule count of [INSTANT] rules is 0 for the purpose of computing proposal STRENGTH. [INSTANT] proposals are not subject to super-mutability after approval, because their effects will have already been executed. This overrides Rule 412. 


#### 411

Super-mutable rules are marked by the designation ‚Äú[SM]‚Äù after the Rule number, on the same line.  These rules may be amended outside of normal turn order. Such changes are not considered Proposals and do not earn the Proposer Points, Prestige, Infamy, or any other credits or penalties associated with normal Proposals. Once changes are affected, the new SM Rule must remain compatible with the Constitution.  Therefore, SM Changes must follow any rules regarding formatting, numbering, etc..

SM changes:



1. Follow the Rules for voting, except that they require unanimous agreement.
2. Are enacted during the Consequence Phase without affecting the current turn.
3. Are not to be affected as part of a normal proposal.  The amendment of a super-mutable rule as part of a proposal is not a super-mutable change.


#### 362

_http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/index.php?date=092408_

Players may consensually enter binding Contracts, publicly or privately. Contractual disputes are subject to Judgement. Judges may make Contracts public during Judgement. Contracts can specify _any_ conditions, including requiring Contract participants to break Rules. Contracts are not Rules and never supersede Rules. 


#### 394

_It tolls for thee_

Rules may have ‚ÄúDEATH KNELLS‚Äù: One-Time effects occurring the instant before a rule‚Äôs repealment or amendment. 

Death Knells cannot be blocked by a newly enacted rule that triggers them, since they are triggered the instant before the repeal or amendment takes effect. 

_DEATH KNELL: Add ‚ÄúDeath Itself‚Äù to the INFAMOUS LIST with the sum of all player Infamies._


#### 395

_Tick_

Rules may have integer length ‚ÄúFUSES.‚Äù When created, a fuse‚Äôs starting length must be ‚â•3. If a fuse length is changed such that it is no longer an integer, it is immediately rounded down to the next integer. 

Immediately when a rule‚Äôs Fuse length becomes ‚â§0, the rule ‚ÄúEXPIRES‚Äù (it is automatically repealed). 


#### 396

_Tock_

Every night at midnight, all Fuses are shortened by 1, in order of increasing rule number. If shortening a fuse has any immediate effects, they are resolved before shortening the next fuse. 


#### 213

If the rules are changed so that further play is impossible, or if the legality of a move is impossible to determine with finality, or if by the Judge's best reasoning, not overruled, a move appears equally legal and illegal, then the first player who is unable to complete a turn is the winner.

This rule takes precedence over every other rule determining the winner.


#### 115

Rule changes that affect rules needed to allow or apply rule changes are as permissible as other rule changes. Even rule changes that amend or repeal their own authority are permissible. No rule change or type of move is impermissible solely on account of the self-reference or self-application of a rule.


#### 114

There must always be at least one mutable rule. The adoption of rule changes must never become completely impermissible.


#### 403

ARTIFACTS are introduced to the game. An ARTIFACT is a virtual object which may have effects upon the game and/or its players and may have rules about their use defined. ARTIFACTS are created through proposals and should define how they are acquired. The person who possesses an ARTIFACT is called its OWNER. ARTIFACTS are discrete objects. ARTIFACTS may be traded, discarded, and destroyed, unless the ARTIFACT or rules declare otherwise.


#### 404

The HOT POTATO may be given to another player at the end of the current OWNER‚Äôs turn, after any effects that depend on the HOT POTATO have been applied. The HOT POTATO may not be traded or destroyed otherwise. The HOT POTATO must not be given back to the PLAYER who gave it to the OWNER. The HOT POTATO must be given to a new player during the CONSEQUENCES phase. If the current player fails to do so, the HOT POTATO must be traded by random selection.

The OWNER of the HOT POTATO has an opportunity to immediately receive up to 7 points when they submit their proposal for a vote, but will receive one point less for every hour after the start of their turn. The HOT POTATO will be worth negative points if held for longer than 8 hours, with no predefined minimum. If the TURN WINDOW ends with no proposal, the HOT POTATO‚Äôs current value is applied to the OWNER‚Äôs score.

EXTENSIONS do not cause the HOT POTATO to lose value. If an EXTENSION is requested and approved, all time between the request and the duration of the EXTENSION pause the HOT POTATO. If the EXTENSION is denied, the HOT POTATO continues to decline in value as if the HOT POTATO was never paused.


### Quests


#### 419

_Quests_

If there are fewer active quests than the number of players at the start of a turn, the active player creates a new quest.

To create a quest, a player rolls dice appropriate to fill in the Quest Template. Each die roll selects a clause from the Quest Clauses in order, and those clauses are used to fill in the Quest Template, in order. The resulting quest is added to Active Quest list.


#### 420

The Quest Template is:

The first player to <goal> before <deadline> completes this quest <primary reward> and their Quest Count increases by 1. The second player to do so <secondary reward> This quest has fuse length <20d3 >. Remove this quest from the active quest list when the fuse expires or the deadline occurs. Death Knell: If no players have completed this quest, all players suffer the following penalty: <penalty>.


#### 421

_The Quest Clauses_

**Goal:**



1. possess 1d3 artifacts or all current artifacts at the start of their turn
2. assume all available roles or 1d4, whichever is less
3. propose a rule that passes true unanimously
4. propose and pass a rule that adds a new role
5. propose and pass a rule that adds a new method to increase win count,
6. propose and pass a rule that adds event cards
7. propose and pass a rule that modifies the quest table
8. propose and pass a rule that adds an artifact

**Deadline**: 



1. any player wins
2. a proposal fails true unanimously
3. a proposal passes true unanimously
4. two proposals fail in succession
5. five proposals pass in succession
6. <the player who created this quest> either becomes the MIPWEL or is no longer the MIPWEL

**Primary Reward: **



1. wins
2. chooses one: gain enough prestige to join the council, or roll 1d6 and gain that many prestige
3. may reduce their infamy by 1dN where N is the infamy of the MIPWEL
4. may have their next vote on a rule proposed by another player count double (cannot be used on your own proposal).
5. may gain any one artifact in any player‚Äôs possession

**Secondary Reward:**



1. gains 1d10 points
2. chooses any player to gain 1 infamy
3. gains 1 prestige

**Penalty**



1. No Penalty
2. Lose 10 points
3. Lose 15 points
4. Reduce win count by 1


### Rules that have no future effects
