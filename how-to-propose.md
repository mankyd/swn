# How To Draft a Proposal

## Step 1: Find the file you want to edit.

Click the "Edit This File" Option (the little pencil).

## Step 2: Make your edits.

Files are written in "Markdown" format. Mostly, just write what looks right.
You can read more about Markdown 
[here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). It supports
basic formatting, like **bold** and _italics_, as well as links, headings,
lists, and more. Try to keep it simple.

## Step 3: "Commit" your changes in a new branch

Enter a descriptive title, and further description below it. Think of this as
a summary for what your changes actually do to the rules.

Tell it you want to create a "**new branch**" and give a short, identifiable
branch name.

## Step 4: Create a "Pull Request".

This step simply summarizes what you did in the previous step. Once you create
a pull request, everyone else will be able to see your change, comment on it, 
and approve or reject it.

**We should not (yet) use the review system for voting.**

You can also create
[draft pull requests](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)
that will allow people to see and comment, but it can't be accepted or rejected
until you finalize it.
